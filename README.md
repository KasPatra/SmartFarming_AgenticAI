## 🧠 Smart Farming Agentic AI

Smart Farming Agentic AI is an AI-powered assistant built using IBM Watsonx.ai that helps farmers get answers to agriculture-related questions—like crop advice, weather insights, pest control, and market prices—using document-based responses in simple language.



## 🌾 Problem Statement

Small-scale farmers often face significant challenges due to limited access to real-time, localized, and actionable agricultural information. This knowledge gap hinders their ability to make timely and data-driven decisions regarding crop selection, soil preparation, pest management, and market selling strategies. Existing advisory systems are either inaccessible, generalized, outdated, or not available in local languages, leading to reduced yields, increased risk, and economic instability.



## 💡 Proposed Solution

To overcome the challenges faced by small-scale farmers, we propose the development of an AI-powered farming assistant built on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. This intelligent agent is designed to deliver real-time, localized agricultural guidance by dynamically retrieving verified data and generating personalized responses.



## 🧰 Technologies Used

IBM cloud lite services

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

IBM Granite model



## ☁️ IBM Cloud Services

IBM Cloud Watsonx AI Studio

IBM Cloud Watsonx AI runtime

IBM Cloud Agent Lab

IBM Granite foundation model



## 🎯 Wow Factors

This agent will significantly reduce guesswork, improve the quality of farming decisions, help small-scale farmers make timely choices, and foster inclusive, data-driven agriculture by making expert knowledge more accessible, localized, and actionable.

Impact:

Reduces dependency on unreliable advice or guesswork

Increases yield and income through data-backed decisions

Empowers rural communities with accessible, tech-driven solutions

Promotes climate-resilient farming through informed planning



## 👥 End Users

Small-scale and marginal farmers Research Institutions and Universities

Agricultural extension 

Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs)

NGOs and Agri-tech startups

State or national agriculture departments

Agri-students or grassroots innovators



### ⚙️ How It Works:

1.User inputs a query (e.g., “How to install Drip irrigation?”)

2.IBM Granite LLM processes the language

3.Vector Index retrieves trusted content from uploaded financial PDFs

4.Agent responds with a grounded, natural-language answer

## 🚀 How to Run & Deploy

1.Log in to IBM Cloud Lite: https://cloud.ibm.com

2.Launch Watsonx.ai Studio

3.Create a new AI Agent

4.Upload financial PDFs to a Vector Index

5.Choose Tools for web search (Google,Wikipedia,DuckDuckGo etc..)

6.Configure agent instructions and topics (restricting AI from answering off-topic questions politely)

7.Test in the preview panel

8.Deploy via web snippet, Streamlit, or custom web UI



## 🔭 Future Scope

Integration with IoT devices (e.g., soil sensors, weather stations) for real-time field data

Mobile app deployment for easy farmer access, even in low-connectivity regions

Personalized learning models based on individual farm data and past decisions

Expansion to more languages and dialects for broader regional coverage

 Satellite data integration for remote crop health and weather monitoring
 
Voice-enabled interaction for non-literate or elderly farmers

Marketplace integration to connect farmers directly with buyers and suppliers

Analytics dashboard for government agencies and NGOs to monitor trends and provide targeted support

Sustainability monitoring to encourage eco-friendly farming practices

Farmer training modules embedded in the agent for continuous learning
